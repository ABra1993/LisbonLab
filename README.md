# Simulations of current- and conductance-based dynamics in Spike Coding Networks
The current respiratory contains simulations of the Spike Coding Network (SCN) developed by Barrett and colleagues (2016):

Barrett, D. G., Deneve, S., & Machens, C. K. (2016). Optimal compensation for neuron loss. Elife, 5, e12454.

The respiratory contains the following directories:
- Current: contains scripts simulating the current-based SCN.
- Conductance: contains scripts simulating the conductance-based SCN.

Each folder contains a script for a network receiving a one-dimensional or a multi-dimensional input signal.

The directory named BoundingBox contains animations of the error space plot for a current-based SCN receiving a two-dimensional input signal.
